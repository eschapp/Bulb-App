# Bulb App

This project was inspired by DIY-ers out there everywhere (myself included!) We have great ideas, see things we love on Pinterest, Twitter and on tv. We want to make them, we want to do awesome things, but we often aren't very organized when we do them. We write things on napkins, tape measurers, scraps of wood and paint chips. Then when we need those measurements, prices, or that crucial shopping list POOF it's gone. Not anymore... this app will help you organize every DIY projects. From that small project of spray painting mason jars to keep ing up with a total reno of the bathroom that you left in the 80s.
